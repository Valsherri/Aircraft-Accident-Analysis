This project analyzes aviation accident data to uncover the key factors contributing to these incidents. Our dataset includes critical information such as aircraft make and model, weather conditions

### Dataset Overview
- **Aircraft Make and Model**: Details of the aircraft involved.
- **Weather Conditions**: Insights into the weather during accidents.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Aircraft Analysis**: Investigate patterns in accident distributions among aircraft types.
- **Weather Analysis**: Examine the impact of weather on accidents to identify trends.

### Clustering Analysis
We will use clustering techniques like KMeans to group similar accidents, allowing us to discover hidden patterns.

### Key Steps
1. Utilize factors such as aircraft type and weather for clustering.
2. Analyze clusters for actionable insights.

### Goal
The goal is to reveal patterns in aviation accidents and provide recommendations to enhance safety. By integrating EDA with clustering techniques, we aim to significantly contribute to aviation safety efforts.
